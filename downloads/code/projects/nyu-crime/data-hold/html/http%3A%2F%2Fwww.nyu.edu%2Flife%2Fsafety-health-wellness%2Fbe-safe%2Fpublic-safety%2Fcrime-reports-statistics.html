<div class="text"><p>New York University Department of Public Safety has a clear and straightforward mission: to create a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors to pursue their goals and aspirations. We meet this demanding task in various ways. The Department of Public Safety employs a staff of 350 trained Uniformed Officers, leadership, and support personnel. We maintain a strong partnership with state and local law enforcement and municipal agencies that are responsive to our concerns. And we provide, a visible presence in and around the campus, so that security officers on post, on patrol, or on their way to and from their respective assignments help enhance safety for the NYU community and our neighbors.</p>
<p>The New York University community is one of the safest areas in Greenwich Village, and Greenwich Village continues to be one of the safest areas in New York City. Statistics maintained by the New York City Police Department have shown a 28 percent reduction in serious crime over the last 9 years.<br>
