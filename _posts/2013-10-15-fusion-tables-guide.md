This may be both the longest and most basic tutorial ever published on how to use [Google Fusion Tables (and spreadsheets) to create a data visualization](/projects/one-offs/mapping-with-fusion-tables/). 

You can check the end result of the work at this [webpage I constructed from Fusion-supplied code](/projects/one-offs/fusion-doh-map/).
