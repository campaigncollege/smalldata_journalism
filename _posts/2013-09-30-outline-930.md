Here are the [class notes for the Sept. 30 class tonight](/class/fall2013/notes-0930/). It's basically an introduction to spreadsheets, but for the purpose of data organization, rather than a focus on just performing sums and averages. We'll get into using Fusion Tables too and the concept of data-grouping, i.e. summarizing. 
I was hoping to get more into Fusion Tables and merging them, but I think we can get to that next week.
