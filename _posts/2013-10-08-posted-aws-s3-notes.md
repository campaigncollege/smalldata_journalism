During last night's class, I had trouble getting everyone through the S3-as-a-web-host process. So I published [a step-by-step guide to how to post web files to S3](/projects/one-offs/using-amazon-s3/). It starts at a very basic level and doesn't even assume you've even signed up for Amazon yet, so there's not much specifically about web development. But getting up a file of your choosing onto the web is a pretty big step on its own. [Check out the guide here](/projects/one-offs/using-amazon-s3/).
