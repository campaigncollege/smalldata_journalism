In case you missed it, Oct. 28 was the final session for the class and dealt with [Killer Visualizations](/class/fall2013/notes-1028/) and how to *avoid* making them.

The [take-home final can be found here](/class/fall2013/class-final-2013). And here are the [project requirements](/class/fall2013/project-fall-2013).

I've also been continuing to add to my [long-list of suggested readings](/readings). Among the latest additions are three books made free:

- [Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.refsmmat.com/statistics/#the-woefully-complete-guide)
- [Use the Index, Luke](http://use-the-index-luke.com/), a great guide for database optimization, something you'll care about when you're dealing with more than a few paltry million records.
- [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa3/)
