I've posted the outline for the first session of the [Data Journalism class, Fall 2013](/class/fall2013/notes-0923/), which includes an overview of the different forms that data journalism can take. I'm not sure we'll actually get through all of this, but hopefully we'll get through learning how to use the Web inspector.
