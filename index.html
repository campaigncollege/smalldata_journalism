    This online reference was created to accomodate my <a href="http://www.scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=WRIT1-CE9787">Fall 2013 Data Journalism</a>, which is part of the Digital Certificate for Journalism at New York University (Continuing Studies).</p> 

  <p>
    The class is only five weeks long but I wanted my students to get a full grasp of the scope and possible paths. Having it online, through Github, makes it easy for me to edit and add, and is something that hopefully can be used by others not in the class.

<h3>The NYU-SCPS Data Journalism class</h3>

<p>Data journalism is one of the fastest growing fields within todayâ€™s media landscape, thanks to the new story formats made possible through the Web, the proliferation of public data sources (including social media), and the variety of software and tools to analyze, collect, and visualize the data.
     </p>     

<p>This course aims to give an overview of data journalism methods and  provide hands-on instruction with popular tools and software to explore data. No single course can teach the full range of concepts and techniques. However, students will learn the broad, practical concepts and tools required to understand unfamiliar datasets to find worthwhile stories.
