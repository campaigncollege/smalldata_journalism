       <p>
    <i>small data Journalism</i> was created to accomodate the <a href="/class">Fall 2013 Data Journalism course</a> at New York University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies.</p> 

  <p>
    I wanted my students to have a convenient place to find course-related information, data files, and guides. Since the course aims to take a practical and generalized approach to data journalism, there's no reason not to open it to the world. And since <a href="https://github.com/{{site.github_repo}}">it's on Github</a>, feel free to submit fixes, suggestions, and criticism. 
   </p>

  <p>There's not much info here except for a <a href="/readings">list of readings</a> and the <a href="/class">class syllabus</a>, but I'll update it throughout the session (and afterwards). You can read more about the authorship and technical details behind this book in the <a href="/about">About section</a>.</p>
