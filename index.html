    <i>small data Journalism</i> was created to accomodate the <a href="/class">Fall 2013 Data Journalism course</a>, which is part of the Digital Certificate for Journalism at New York University (Continuing Studies).</p> 

  <p>
    I wanted my students to have a convenient place to find course-related information, files, and guides. Since the course aims to take a practical and generalized approach to data journalism, there's no reason not to open it to the world. And since <a href="https://github.com/{{site.github}}">it's on Github</a>, feel free to submit fixes, suggestions, and criticism.
