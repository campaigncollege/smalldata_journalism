This is now an image, not a chart.


## Creating an image file

## Pros
- Very easy to show to the (computerized) world
- No longer need Excel to view it



## Cons
- Essentially, unalterable. To make adjustments, you have to go back into Excel and repeat the export process.
- Still relying on owning Excel to produce the chart.
- Still don't have a way to show just anyone on the Internet
