guff: "If you're like me, maybe you had so much fun hand-drawing charts that you wonder why we bother using computers in the first place? Aesthetic concerns aside, computers allow for no-cost (except for actually buying the computer) distribution of our work."

Fair warning: the next five chapters have nothing to do with visualization design. If you've ever maintained your own webpage and/or written a few lines of HTML, you probably aren't going to learn much. However, the purpose of these short, breezy chapters is to show how far you can get with a simple static image. And its principles are important to know for the rest of this project.

Note: You don't actually need to have hand-drawn a chart in the last chapter. You can just **right-click-Save-As** my [chart file here](TK) and follow along.

## Digitizing the photo

First, let's get the hand-drawn image onto the computer. This is going to involve an optical device of some sort, whether it's your office scanner or your camera phone (I've opted for the latter).

Now get the image file onto your desktop. If you did a phone-capture of it and don't have it auto-sync to the cloud, then simply:

1. Navigate to where the photo exists on your phone (i.e. the **Photos** app, or whatever it's called)
2. Email it to your personal email account.
3. Open that selfie-email and right-click the attachment (or click **Save As**)
4. Save the image to your desktop/Downloads folder. It probably has an extension like `jpg`


## Working with image files

I'm not going to get into a discussion of image formats; all you need to know is that they exist, and the most common ones have file extensions of `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.gif`. 

Locate the file that you downloaded and **right-click** on it. Your operating system should give you an option named something like **Open with...**, which will give you a list of programs that can open image files.

Here's my list (it varies depending on what you've installed on your computer):

  TKIMG

If you're on a Mac, the default image viewer will likely be **Preview**. Go ahead and try it.

OK, you should also have the option to open the image file with **one of your web browsers**. Here's what it looks like when I open it in Firefox:

TKIMG

It's like it's on the Web, and yet this file exists on our hard drive. What's going on?

### The difference between image files and webpages


## Sharing the photo

OK, so the photo is now on your computer. And in fact, if you followed my instructions above, it's been all over the Internet already. However, if you have little working experience with the Web, it may not be obvious how you *share* the file on the Web.

That's OK, we cover the myriad of ways to do so in the next chapter. For now, you at least know how to share the image *via email*.

Now let's see what we've gained (and lost) by digitizing our drawings.


## Advantages
- Very easy to show to the (computerized) world
- No longer need Excel to view it



## Disadvantages
- Essentially, unalterable. To make adjustments, you have to go back into Excel and repeat the export process.
- Still relying on owning Excel to produce the chart.
- Still don't have a way to show just anyone on the Internet
