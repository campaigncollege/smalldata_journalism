### Pros
- Anyone with the link can view it

### Cons
- If the image server goes down, the file is gone
- Still dependent on Excel to produce the image
- If you need to edit the graphic, you have to go back into Excel and re-upload the image
- Anyone with a link of the chart will not have the updated chart.
- Doesn't have much search engine juice; the text is not easily parsable
