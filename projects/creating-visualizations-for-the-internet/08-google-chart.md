### Pros
- Finally, no longer need to go into Excel to update the data
- Some interactivity is allowed

### Cons
- Now you have to know a little JavaScript
- Now you have to figure out Google's format
- If Google drops the service, no more chart
- If Google goes down, chart is not viewable
- JavaScript is its own program, and sometimes doesn't always work
- Without programming, can be a pain to manually change the data
