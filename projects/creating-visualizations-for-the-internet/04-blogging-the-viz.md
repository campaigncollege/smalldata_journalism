### Create a Tumblr
#### Blog a "photo"

### Open a Wordpress
#### Insert a photo


### Pros
- You control the image, you can change it out and users who revisit the page will see it
- You can add text and change it very easily. You can add context

### Cons
- Now you have to know how to operate blog software
- Still have the problem if the blog service shuts down
- If the graphic needs to be changed, still have to go back into Excel
