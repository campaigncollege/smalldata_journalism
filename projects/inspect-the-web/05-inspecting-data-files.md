In the last chapter, we learned how the **Network panel** provides an overview of the files our browser downloads when visiting website. In this chapter, we'll use the Network panel to examine those files in detail.

Rather than re-explore this site's homepage, I've [created a special page](/examples/data-inspection/) for all the examples we'll cover. Check it out here:

[www.smalldatajournalism.com/examples/data-inspection/](/examples/data-inspection/)

## Basic detail inspection

Pop open the **Network** panel and visit the [link above](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/examples/data-inspection/) and watch the traffic come in. 

Then:

1. Click the **Images** file type filter.
2. Click on the filename for `sailboat.jpg` entry

Instead of the Network table view, you should see a new subpanel:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-001-sailboat.jpg)


We'll call that subpanel to the right the **Details subpanel**. This subpanel has a few tabs of its own and by default, **Headers** should be selected. If at any time, you want to go back to the tabular view, **click the X** in the left corner.

### Examining an Image

The **Details subpanel** will contain far more information than you'll likely need to know as a non-web developer. So we'll first run through the basic features with a file format we're all familiar with: an image.

### The Headers tab

When you visit your neighbor to borrow a cup of flour, you don't just open his door and find him waiting wordlessly with a cup of flour. Usually you call ahead to see if he's home and if he has flour. Or at least knock, identify yourself and what you want. Similarly, your neighbor will likely say "Hi" and, hopefully, "Of course, I have that flour, please come on over."

Your browser and a web server are not so different, and the **Headers** view shows the salutations involved in exchanging files. This view has two sections: **Request** and **Response** headers.

#### Request Headers

These headers include information that the server will find useful in accommodating our request:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-005-sailboat-request-headers.png)

Look at this header:

    Accept:image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

We may not know what this means exactly. But as we're looking at the **details** for a file named `sailboat.jpg`, it makes sense that we're telling the server that we're looking to *accept* some image data.

Here's another header that should seem familiar:
    
    User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.76 Safari/537.36

I'm currently on a Mac with OS X 10.8.4 and am indeed using Chrome 29.0. If you were on an iPad, your `User-Agent` might look like this:

     Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405

You can read more [about user agent strings at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent_string). For now, we'll move on as the request headers for an image file aren't too interesting.


#### Response Headers

These headers contain information from the server pertaining to your request:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-005-sailboat-response-headers.png)



These might make sense to you:

    Content-Length:78858
    Content-Type:image/jpeg

These headers are reasonable given that we're looking at the headers for the `sailboat.jpg` request, and 78KB is a reasonable size for such a photo. 

Again, with a simple image file, there's not too much to dissect. 
You can see a [full list of headers at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields), but don't worry about memorizing them. There's only a few that we care about for this lesson.


Let's move on to the other tabs.



#### The Preview and Response tabs

This tab simply shows a quick preview of the file at hand. And since we're looking at an image file, the preview is not much different than what we already see in the browser:


![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-015-sailboat-preview.jpg)


This tab will be more useful when we look at actual data files, as data files generally aren't visible on the web page. The **Response** tab usually shows something similar to the **Preview** tab, so you can pick either one when trying to dissect a data file.

-----

Click the `X` at the top-left of the **Details subpanel** to return to the tabular view. Now we'll look at data files, which, I repeat again, are *just text*.



## Inspecting data files

It's not (usually) interesting to inspect the details of image files, as image files are usually visible on a webpage. 

But data files are usually *not* meant to be seen, at least in their naked raw format. So now we'll go into the [*cue clich√© reference to The Matrix here*] and past the pretty facade that the webpage renders around that data.

### Tweet Count

On [the demo page](/examples/data-inspection/), scroll down to the next section, which should show a Twitter widget/button like this:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-042-tweet-button.png)

That button may look like just another image, but it's a little more sophisticated than that. More relevant to our concerns, **it comes with a small data payload**.

Check out the number next to the little birdie. At time of writing, its value is **0** &ndash; and I don't expect it to change much.

Now open the tabular view of the **Network** panel. Filter for **Other** types of files. You should see something like this:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-050-tweet-button-other-filter.png)

This part's a little confusing because there's *two* Tweet buttons &ndash; one is here and one is at the bottom of the page. Ignore the two files that have the **Type** of `pending` and select the first one that has, as its **Type**, `application/javascript`. This should pop you into the **Detail** subpanel:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-055-tweet-button-detail-headers.png)

The **Headers** view is a little cluttered and confusing, so let's click on the **Preview** tab:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-055-tweet-button-detail-preview.png)

The filetype we're currently inspecting is called **JSON**. For our purposes, we just need to know that it's a lightweight way to send structured data *as text*:

    twttr.receiveCount({"count":0,"url":"http:\/\/www.smalldatajournalism.com\/examples\/data-inspection\/"});

I'll trim the irrelevant part and format its whitespace to make it a little prettier:

    {
      "count": 0,
      "url": "http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/examples/data-inspection/"
    }


Does that `count` value look familiar? In my case, it reflects the `0` seen on the webpage. If I had to take a guess, this is data the Twitter server sends out for the webpage to display. Similarly, if instead of a Tweet button, I had a **Facebook Likes** widget, you'd expect the Facebook server to transmit a data snippet so that my webpage knows how many "Likes" it has received.

(Remember in the last chapter, we learned that the webpage you're on &ndash; in this case, hosted at `www.smalldatajournalism.com` &ndash; may call in third-party code, such as from Twitter)

OK, there's not much more else to inspect with the Tweet button. So move on to the **U.S. Population By Region** headline.

### Simple Data Chart

What you see on the demo page should *look like* an image:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-072-us-pop-rickshaw.png)

In fact, it's a web data graphic, made using the [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [Rickshaw](https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw) JavaScript libraries. And if you're not a web developer, you're probably thinking, "So....?" 

The bottom line is that it's not a PNG or JPG file. And there's a data file used to generate it. Pop open the Network panel again and filter for `XHR` filetypes:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-081-us-pop-filter-xhr.png)

Click on the file named `rickshaw-data.json` and then the **Response** tab:

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-083-us-pop-preview.png)

You should see some nicely formatted JSON again:

    [
      {
        "name": "Northeast",
        "data": [
          {
            "x": -1893456000,
            "y": 25868573
          },
          {
            "x": -1577923200,
            "y": 29662053
          },
          {
            "x": -1262304000,
            "y": 34427091
          },
          {
            "x": -946771200,
            "y": 35976777
          },
          
          ...

The label `"Northeast"` is listed on the chart's **legend**. Those numbers probably don't seem to relate to anything. Rather than explain them, I'll [leave it to the Rickshaw graphing tutorial](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/tutorial/introduction.html) to explain how they're sourced to the U.S. Census Bureau. 

For the purposes of our lesson, it's just another example of: "Look, the webpage is made up of data files!"


Close the **Details** panel and scroll on down to the final example for this chapter.

### Choropleth map

This U.S. map is a variation of [Mike Bostock's D3 Choropleth Map](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606), which shows 2008 unemployment rates by **county**, using color variation for the different rates &ndash; **darker** means *higher* unemployment.

The map [on the demo page](/examples/data-inspection/) differs in that I'm showing the **difference** between unemployment rates, from 2010 to 2012. The **darker** the color, the *greater* the **drop in unemployment rate**:


![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-112-choropleth-counties.jpg)


The fact that I've ripped off [Bostock's code](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) should immediately clue you in what to expect. The code used to generate the map must pull in data from some easily switchable source. In fact, this is what you should suspect of most non-trivial web widgets and graphics. 

It's not as if Bostock created a program for the purpose of displaying U.S. 2008 unemployment rate by county as a choropleth map. Rather, Bostock has created a choropleth-map-making program that, in his example, happens to display U.S. 2008 unemployment rates by county. 

In other words, his choropleth code is a *reusable container* for data. This is more than a semantic difference, it's the sane mindset of every good developer. For our purposes though, it means that the data behind the map will likely be in their own (text) files, as it has been in the previous examples in the demo.

Pop open the Network panel and filter by the **XHR** file type: 

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-125-choropleth-preview.png)

There's two files that are related to this example: `choropleth-us.json` and `choropleth-data.csv`.

Let's look at the **Response** tab for `choropleth-us.json`. You should see something like this:

    {"type":"Topology","objects":{"counties":{"type":"GeometryCollection",
    "geometries":[{"type":"Polygon","id":53073,"arcs":[[0,1,2,3]]},{"type":"Polygon","id":30105,"arcs":[[4,5,6,7,8,9]]
    },{"type":"Polygon","id":30029,"arcs":[[10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]]
    },{"type":"Polygon","id":16021,"arcs":[[20,21,22,23]]
    },{"type":"Polygon","id":30071,"arcs":[[-9,24,25,26,27,28,29]]
    },{"type":"Polygon","id":38079,"arcs":[[30,31,32,33]]


Since we're looking at a map, you could assume that this data is referring to *shapes* of things, and those things are like U.S. county boundaries. Another clue is the fact that `choropleth-us.json` is by far the biggest file downloaded by the demo page.

Now look at the **Response** for the `choropleth-data.csv`. The inspector doesn't do a great job showing the file data: 

![](/images/projects/inspect-the-web/05-150-choropleth-data-response.png)

So **double-click** on the `choropleth-data.csv` filename in the left column. This should initiate a download. If you check your Downloads folder, you should have a new file named `choropleth-data.csv`.

If you're unfamiliar with CSV files, they're simply text-files in which the data is **delimited**, i.e. separated by **commas** &ndash; "CSV" is short for **comma-separated values**. Programs like Microsoft Excel treat this *delimited* text as data.

Here's what the data looks like in tabular format:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>county_name</th><th>rate_2010</th><th>rate_2012</th><th>rate_diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5001</td><td>Arkansas County, AR</td><td>16.8</td><td>7.7</td><td>9.1</td></tr><tr><td>8033</td><td>Dolores County, CO</td><td>17.1</td><td>9.5</td><td>7.6</td></tr><tr><td>26013</td><td>Baraga County, MI</td><td>23.4</td><td>16.4</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>39071</td><td>Highland County, OH</td><td>16.1</td><td>9.6</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>39027</td><td>Clinton County, OH</td><td>16.3</td><td>10.3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>28159</td><td>Winston County, MS</td><td>18.2</td><td>12.4</td><td>5.8</td></tr><tr><td>21169</td><td>Metcalfe County, KY</td><td>13.7</td><td>8</td><td>5.7</td></tr><tr><td>1063</td><td>Greene County, AL</td><td>17</td><td>11.4</td><td>5.6</td></tr><tr><td>26001</td><td>Alcona County, MI</td><td>18.1</td><td>12.6</td><td>5.5</td></tr></tbody></table>


## Naked data

Hopefully, this tour of the **Network** panel has illuminated a few useful truths about the Web for you. With the **Elements** panel, we saw how much of the Web is *just* text. Now we see that web pages can also be made of many different files.

This means that with the Network panel, we can inspect each file individually. Many interactive web pages are *containers* that pull in data files. When we inspect those data files individually to see their raw data, we're essentially telling the web page: *Thanks, but we'll take the data as is. No need to pretty it up for us.*

I made use of this concept during the [Dollars for Doctors investigation at ProPublica](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars), in which I had to collect and parse lists of financial transactions from several different drug companies.

One company had decided to display their list as a Flash application, which, while attractive, made it impossible to just highlight and copy the text. Whether or not the company did this deliberately to try to make their list harder to copy, I couldn't say. But after inspecting the web traffic on the page, their data ended up being the easiest to copy. You can see [the details in my writeup here](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/reading-flash-data).

So the Network panel has some practical uses when it comes to finding source files. And if you ever become a web developer, the Network panel is indispensable for diagnosing your work. But the main insight you should internalize before moving on to the final chapter is: TK
