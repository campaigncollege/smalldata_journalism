A [web data firm recently offered its secrets to the public](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/04/218889785/get-a-glimpse-of-the-data-marketers-have-about-you). By *secrets*, I mean, the secrets *you* have shared, through your web browsing,  methodically gathered by this data firm and its many brokers.

*How did they find out?*

In this final chapter of our brief acquaintance with the Web inspector, we'll take what we've learned thus far to one of its logical conclusions: If webpages &ndash; their text, images, and widgets &ndash; are an assemblage of discrete pieces. And each piece is something we send *requests* for. Then our requests themselves are a piece about who we are.


(Note: In order to take up that company on its offer, you have to tell it even more information about yourself. I don't recommend doing that. Reading [the article should give you the gist of it](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/04/218889785/get-a-glimpse-of-the-data-marketers-have-about-you).)

## Knowing what we don't know

If this all seems confusing, it should be. I've only shown you half of this side, how to see what data you actually send and where it is sent?

But what happens to the data that is actually stored? For a Facebook Like, the result is obvious: your friend sees a Like (and presumably, all your other friends). But what else is in that data snippet?
