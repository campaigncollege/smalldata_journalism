## Answers


## Mostly just text

OK, technically your typical Web page contains a few things that aren't text, such as images, videos, and music. But the important part, *where these media files are located*, are specified *in text*.

It's easy enough to see this in the **Elements** panel, but in the next chapter, we'll learn to use a new Inspector panel, designed specifically to see how the different pieces of a Web page come together in real-time.
