In contrast to the last chapter, this chapter will have a much shorter useful lifespan. By the time I finish writing this, Microsoft could overhaul the interface to Excel. Or Google could just decide to quit the business game and take with it all of its cloud services, including Spreadsheets and Fusion Tables.

But we can't wait around for technology to get itself figured out, so here's a step-by-step guide to all the techniques we'll use to work with our data, using software as it exists in 2013. Because of the ephemeral nature of the software and the interfaces involved, I'll try to remind you of the concepts behind each technique, just in case, someday, you need to do data analysis with just charcoal and cave walls.
