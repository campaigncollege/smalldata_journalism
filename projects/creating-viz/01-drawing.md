## Back to the drawing board

Maybe the easiest way to isolate the work of data visualization from technology is to make something by hand.

But before turning off the computer, let's look up some data.

## Data gathering

For our visualization, we'll look at unemployment rates. These typically come in by month, but to make things simple, we'll just pick a month &ndash; April &ndash; to sample from each year. And let's just do this year and the 10 years before, so: 2003 to 2013.

And to make it interesting, we'll compare two countries: the United States and Germany, which makes it 22 data points in all:

[United States April unemployment rates](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000)

2003  6.0
2004  5.6
2005  5.2
2006  4.7
2007  4.5
2008  5.0
2009  9.0
2010  9.9
2011  9.0
2012  8.1
2013  7.5

## Drawing the chart

Now you can turn off your computer, find some pens and paper, and draw yourself a chart.

(this is by far the most annoying part of this project)

OK, done?

Here's how mine turned out:

## Advantages

### No technological barrier to create it 
Believe it or not, there are big advantages to drawing by hand. One, you don't have to learn anything beyond what you picked up in secondary, or even grade school. There's no technology used to make it. 

### No technological barrier to view it
And, just as importantly, there's no new technology needed to *see* it: if you want to know the story of American and German economies this past decade, you just look at this piece of paper I drew on.

The complexity of viewing a visualization will become a major &ndash; if not the *main* factor as we get more technologically advanced.

## Disadvantages

### Takes a long time
Well, for starters, this took me way longer than it should have. And it's not particularly attractive, thanks to my poor penmanship.  You'll notice where I've scratched out some numbers. I scaled my x-axis poorly but since it took me so long to just draw the axis, I wasn't going to start over.

### Can't easily correct mistakes
You'll notice my dots and lines are a bit off, which can be deceiving when the amounts involved are single-digit percentages. And you might say my non-zero y-axis is deceiving. Well, if I want to fix that, I have to start all over.

### Hard to distribute

Let's pretend I didn't know how to scan my drawing and post it to the Internet. The number of people who can see my visualization are limited to who's ever within a 5 feet radius of me, which is not many people.

### Hard to build on or update
In a few years, I'll run out of space to add more data points. And if I wanted to add another country whose unemployment rate surpasses the current axes range, I'll have to create a whole new graph.


## Moving forward

So the disadvantages of hand-drawing your charts are evident. Let's see how much easier it is when we figure out a spreadsheet program in the next chapter. And, let's see what new problems we cause for ourselves.
