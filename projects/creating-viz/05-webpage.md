## It's just text

Beneath the pretty layouts, parallax scrolling, and dancing babies, webpages are made up of *just text*. Which for us means two important things:

1. You can edit and change a webpage as easy as you change any kind of text document.
2. If you can read English, you'll be able to get the gist of things.

For a closer examination of HTML, [check out my tutorial on the web inspector](/projects/inspect-the-web). For our purposes here, we won't be spending much time trying to actually understand HTML.

### Download a text-editor

You'll need a **plain text editor** for this. Do *not* use Microsoft Word or TextEdit. Web pages are made up of HTML code, and this code is *just text* &ndash; rich document editors add all kinds of formatting we don't want.

There are several great text-editors that can be had or tried for free:

- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is cross-platform and is the text-editor of choice for many a programmer. But it'll be great for our simple purposes, too. It has a 30-day-free trial.
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is "free" as in "free beer" and happens to be one of the better text-editors for **Windows**.
- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) is a full-featured yet free editor for **Mac OS X**. You can also download it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12â€Ž).

### Open a new text file

Pop-open your text editor and if it doesn't already by default, create a new text file (click **File** on the menubar, and something like **New...**).

Here's what it looks like in Sublime Text for the Mac:




### Write (or copy and paste) a little HTML

### Include the image file

### Add a headline



## All together




## The takeaway



### Pros
- You have complete control of how the image is seen, where it is located, etc.

### Cons
- Now you have to know some HTML
- If the graphic needs to be changed, still have to go back into Excel
