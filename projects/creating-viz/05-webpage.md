## It's just text
- You'll need a text editor for this. Do not use Microsoft Word or TextEdit.

### Open a new text file

### Write (or copy and paste) a little HTML

### Include the image file

### Add a headline



## All together


## The takeaway



### Pros
- You have complete control of how the image is seen, where it is located, etc.

### Cons
- Now you have to know some HTML
- If the graphic needs to be changed, still have to go back into Excel
