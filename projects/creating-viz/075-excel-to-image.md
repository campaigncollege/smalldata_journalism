guff: "This is a short transition chapter to show how we can move Excel to a more universal file format and what we gain, and lose, in the conversion."

In the previous chapter, we created a nifty chart by entering our data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet file contains the data and the image and we're able to easily update and adjust the numbers and chart design.

However, when it comes to sharing, we've lost some universality: users must have Microsoft Excel &ndash; or a compatible spreadsheet program &ndash; to view the file. It's not something you can just post to your blog.
