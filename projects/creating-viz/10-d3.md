In this final chapter, we'll render our unemployment line chart using the most sophisticated of web visualization libraries: [D3.js]


## Data-driven documents

Among the web visualization libraries, D3 &ndash; short for "Data-Driven Documents", is both at the cutting edge and in the mainstream &ndash; it's [the library of choice at NYTimes.com](http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/nyts-512-paths-white-house/) and would likely be the choice even if D3's creator, [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), weren't a current NYT employee.

Check out the [D3 gallery for just a small sample of incredible work](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).

This chapter will show you how to produce a simple D3 line chart. But the purpose is not to be an actual tutorial. Instead, I want to show the similarities D3 has with other JavaScript libraries when it comes to *production*, as these considerations remain the same no matter the visual potential of the library.


The flexibility of D3's design allows developers to create anything from [Stephen Few's classic bullet charts](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061961) to [custom chord diagrams for the Euro debt crisis](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1308257). But that flexibility can be a curse to those just wanting to easily create simple charts. In fact, there are entire frameworks that simply serve to make D3 more approachable, such as [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) and [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/).

In other words, even if D3 is indisputably the current king of visualization libraries, it doesn't necessarily follow that to make the best online visualization, you *must* use D3.

## Creating the HTML

The HTML container for a D3 visualization is similar to what we've seen before, particularly with the Highcharts.js example. The most important change is to include the d3.js code file in lieu of highcharts.js, of course.

Here's the HTML skeleton:

{% include_code projects/creating-viz/d3-chart/d3-skeleton.html %}


## The D3 JavaScript code

No single chapter would be enough to explain the ins and outs of D3's code design, so I've settled for copying Mike Bostock's [line chart example nearly verbatim](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955); you'll see that the code snippet is not quite as concise as we've seen in the other JavaScript examples:

(Warning: I'm not going to even try to explain it, so I suggest not trying to interpret it without outside help):

{% include_code projects/creating-viz/d3-chart/d3-line-chart.js %}


## The data format

If you did read that code carefully, you'll notice that the actual data is not anywhere in that code snippet. In fact, where you put the actual data is a matter of preference and design. In past examples, we put it in the JavaScript code snippet itself. One very nice feature of D3 is built-in support for reading comma-delimited (CSV) and tab-delimited text files (TSV). 

Our Excel spreadsheet can be exported to either of those text-formats. I chose TSV for now. And so there's a line in the JavaScript snippet above that refers to the TSV filename:

    d3.tsv("unemployment-data.tsv",


That file is just plain text and it looks like this:

    Year  U.S.  Germany
    2003  6 9.8
    2004  5.6 10.2
    2005  5.2 11.5
    2006  4.7 10.4
    2007  4.5 8.9
    2008  5 7.8
    2009  9 7.8
    2010  9.9 7.3
    2011  9 6.1
    2012  8.1 5.5
    2013  7.5 5.4



## The complete file

All together:

{% include_code projects/creating-viz/d3-chart/d3-final.html %}



### The rendered chart

You can view the chart in [its own HTML file here](/downloads/code/projects/creating-viz/d3-chart/d3-final.html)

But here's what the live JavaScript chart looks like when executed:


<div>  
{% render_partial downloads/code/projects/creating-viz/d3-chart/embedded.html %}
</div>

You will find many things to nitpick about it, including the lack of interactivity and the amateurish labels and axes. But as I said at the beginning of this chapter, this isn't about how to actually design D3 visualizations, just how to get one up and working. 

If there was any hope that *just using a* library will automatically endow quality upon a visualization &ndash; something that's implied when you hear, "It's built with [insert cutting-edge thing here]!!" &ndash; I hope my mediocre demonstration has dashed that hope.



## Advantages
 
##### D3 is cutting-edge

##### Interoperability

## Concerns

##### Browser compatability

##### Complexity

##### Future compatability
