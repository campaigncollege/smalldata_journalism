By **right-clicking** on the chart, you have the option to configure how it looks, such as the color of each line, the font-size, and the way the axes are labeled.


## Pros

- Once you have the data, creating charts is just a few clicks away
- Easy to alter the graph
- Easy to add new data


## Cons
- You have to learn a computer program
- Can't do it without a computer and the right software
- Can't view it without a computer and the right software
