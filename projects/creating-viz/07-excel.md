By **right-clicking** on the chart, you have the option to configure how it looks, such as the color of each line, the font-size, and the way the axes are labeled.


### Edit the data

### Share on the Internet


## The takeaway
- easy to adjust things, edit and numbers
- not as easy to share as an image file.


### Advantages

- Once you have the data, creating charts is just a few clicks away
- Easy to alter the graph
- Easy to add new data


### Concerns

- You have to learn a computer program
- Can't do it without a computer and the right software
- Can't view it without a computer and the right software
