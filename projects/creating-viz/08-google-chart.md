## Creating the HTML file



## Adding the Google Charts JavaScript code


## The data format



## All together


### Edit numbers, colors and data on the fly


## The takeaway

- You can edit numbers on the fly for truly dynamic graphs
- Your graphs can be interactive
- You're notw working inside a new set of rules. JavaScript is ubiquitous now, but even the simplest JavaScript chart will have more compatability issues than a static image.



### Pros
- Finally, no longer need to go into Excel to update the data
- Some interactivity is allowed

### Cons
- Now you have to know a little JavaScript
- Now you have to figure out Google's format
- If Google drops the service, no more chart
- If Google goes down, chart is not viewable
- JavaScript is its own program, and sometimes doesn't always work
- Without programming, can be a pain to manually change the data
