**NYU Homepage**: [http://www.scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=WRIT1-CE9787](http://www.scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=WRIT1-CE9787)

The rise of personal computing and the Internet has transformed data journalism, long a niche of the newsroom, into one of the most visible fields in today's media landscape. However, while new technologies and techniques have made data journalism more accessible to audiences, they have also made data journalism increasingly intimidating to those who wish to practice it.

This course aims to examine data journalism at its core, through case studies and hands-on practice of modern data skills. Because the course is only five weeks, we will focus on the practical concepts and tools needed to explore unfamiliar datasets to find worthwhile stories.

By the end of the course, students will be expected to have the experience and intuition to ask (and, to some degree, answer) these questions:

-  Why should anyone care about this data?
-  How can I explore, analyze, and compare this data?
-  How can I tell the story of this data?

This class will be taught in a small group setting with a focus on hands-on instruction.


### Prerequisites

## Policies and Academics


### Academic Integrity

Plagiarism involves borrowing or using information from other sources without proper and full credit. Students are expected to demonstrate how what they have learned incorporates an understanding of the research and expertise of scholars and other appropriate experts; and thus recognizing others’ published work or teachings – whether that of authors, lecturers, or one’s peers – is a required practice in all academic projects.” 

The full policy is located at: http://www.scps.nyu.edu/about-scps/policies-and-procedures/  

It will be strictly enforced.

### Students with disabilities

New York University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students with disabilities. Any student who needs a reasonable accommodation based on a qualified disability is required to register with The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) for assistance.


### Grading Criteria

It's assumed that students will have a wide range of technical skills and this will greatly impact the scope of work that they can produce for this class. For example, a student experienced in SQL will be able to analyze and chart a dataset involving millions of rows. 

But this class will be graded less on technical expertise and more on critical thinking and deductive reasoning. If a student has trouble working with software but can explain in detail how he/she would inspect a real-world dataset, the process for joining other datasets to it, the expected insights from standard analytical methods, and the anticipated pitfalls and inherent limitations of the data, that student would meet this course’s standards.

#### Grading Components

- 25% &ndash; Class Participation/Attendance 
- 25% &ndash; Quiz/Homework
- 25% &ndash; Project
- 25% &ndash; Final
