## Introduction

This page contains the answers to the final for my NYU-SCPS Data Journalism class for Fall 2013; [you can see the final sans answers here](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/class/fall2013/class-final-2013/). The final was take-home and short-answer, though a few students demonstrated the answers with spreadsheets/visualizations of their own. 

My comments and answers are marked in <span style="color: #707;">orange</span> and where possible, I try to link back to [reading material](/readings) and examples we discussed in [class](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/class/) to justify the answers.



## Analysis

Correlation does not equal causation. In each of the (fictional) examples below, a plausible assertion is made **in bold**. However, each of these claims are suspect.

**For each of these claims**, either describe a flaw in the statistical reasoning, or describe at least one *additional* source information you would need to verify the claim. 

**Example assertion:** 

In the city of Springfield, hospitals devote an average of 6% of their operating budgets on their cardiac surgery departments. Springfield Municipal, however, devotes 15% of its budget to cardiac surgery.

Yet despite the increased funding, Springfield Municipal averages 7 deaths per 1,000 open-heart surgeries, compared to a rate of 2.3 among other Springfield hospitals. **Clearly, Springfield Municipal is misspending its cardiac funds.**

**Example answers**

1. Just because Springfield Municipal is spending more than twice of its budget *proportionally* on heart surgery doesn't mean that it is spending *more* money overall. If its budget is $10 million, 15% of that is $1.5 million. However, if the average hospital has a budget of $100 million and thus spends $6 million on cardiac surgery, then the average hospital actually spends 4 times as much as Springfield Municipal in absolute terms.
2. The mortality rate says nothing about the health of the patients that Springfield Municipal sees. If Municipal is considered to have the best cardiac surgery team in the city, then it may also be the hospital in which highest risk cardiac patients are sent. Therefore, we need to know the expected mortality rate of cardiac patients for each hospital in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison.


**Now respond to the following assertions:**
---------------------

\1. For every 100,000 people, at least 48 die annually from knife-related accidents. In comparison, only 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people can be attributed to hand grenades. **Therefore, hand grenades are nearly 100 times safer than knives.**

<span class="my-notes">
Beware of the authorative-sounding nature of percentages, just because a claim involves a _rate_ doesn't mean that it is more of an accurate or scientific conclusion.
</span>

<span class="my-notes">
In the assertion above, it's not the rate _alone_ that is important, but the _population_ from which the grenade and knife death rates are derived. Are we talking about 0.5 deaths for every 100,000 _grenade owners_? Or just 100,000 in the _general population_? Because if it is the latter, then the comparison of death rate is nearly useless. Assuming that in a general (peacetime) population, there are far more knife owners than grenade owners, then the fact that grenade deaths are very rare could mean that just very few people are actually around grenades. If more people owned (and used) grenades in everyday life, the rates here are likely to change.

\2. In a random sampling of deaths among 18 to 40-year olds who consumed an average of 3 alcoholic beverages a week, nearly 35 percent of the deaths were alcohol-related, e.g. accidents and liver disease. However, in a sampling of deaths among 80 to 100-year olds who consumed at least 5 alcoholic beverages a week, only 20 percent of the deaths were alcohol-related. **Therefore, we can conclude that drinking more alcohol will reduce your chances of having an alcohol-related death.**

<span class="my-notes">

This is an example of [survivor bias](http://freakonomics.com/2009/09/17/survivor-bias-on-the-gridiron/), in a very literal sense. People who live to be more than 80 years old are a rare subset of the general population, so it raises the question: how did they manage to live that long? High personal wealth, strong social support systems, and good genetics play a part in that. And for our particular scenario, how the _heck_ did they live to be 80+ even after drinking all that alcohol (assuming they didn't take up drinking late in life)?

We don't know for sure, and it would help to know the size of the population here. Perhaps most people in this 80+ year old group also have that rare invincible liver-gene. Or, more likely, if you've been averaging several alcoholic drinks a day for more than 60 years, then you can be said to have successfully avoided the bad behaviors that typically cause alcohol-related deaths.

On the other hand, if you live in an industrialized nation, dying before 40 is a rare occasion. And those who die young from causes related to alcohol consumption &ndash; such as alcohol poisoning or drunk driving &ndash; did not have the same luck or discretion as those in the elderly drinking club. One of my students pointed another factor: younger people may also have more exposure to risky drinking activities, such as pairing alcohol with other drugs, than the average elderly person. 

And of course, there is plenty of plain sample bias here. The top causes of death are distinctly different between the young and the elderly.  From the ages of 1 to 44 in the U.S., the leading cause of death is "Unintentional injury", according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/10LCID_All_Deaths_By_Age_Group_2010-a.pdf), whereas from 65+ onwards, heart disease is the dominant killer.

So even if there's no difference in risky drinking behavior between the young and the elderly, the fact that most elderly succumb to heart disease may be enough to reduce the percentage of their alcohol-related deaths.

\3. When a movie franchise has *at least one sequel*, the franchise *averages* $25 million more in revenue **per movie** than the average individual movie. **Therefore, given an original screenplay, a movie studio should prepare to film a sequel as soon as possible, in order to maximize revenue**. 


<span class="my-notes">

This is just confusing cause with effect. Why are sequels made? Because the original movie made a lot of money. [Even movies that necessitate a sequel won't get one if the first bombed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Compass_(film)#Sequels).

While there are standalone movies that do well ("Titanic" comes to mind) without spawning a sequel, almost all first-in-a-series movies have performed well. So it's a good assumption that they will also have respectiable revenues on average, at least compared to any given standalone movie.

\4. From the year 2008 to 2012, SAT scores among Springfield High seniors jumped 38%. Shelbyville High seniors, however, had a 1% drop in overall SAT scores. **Therefore, we can conclude that Springfield High graduates will have a better chance of going to a prestigious college.** 

<span class="my-notes">
Note: I probably should've stated that we're dealing with _averages_ here, not that it makes a real difference in this situation.

This is an example where percentages _alone_ don't provide enough context. If Springfield High's average SAT score in 2008 was 1000, then a 38% increase moves that average to 1380. However, if Shelbyville started at an average of 2000, then a 1% drop still leaves them at a 1980. I'll leave aside the notion that better SAT scores translates into a "better chance" at college admissions, but if that's the only criteria we have, then Shelbyville still comes out on top.

In general, whenever a claim sticks solely to percentages, without once mentioning the actual absolute numbers, you should immediately suspect that it's hiding something. A common scenario is when huge percentages are trumpeted &ndash; _Our book sales jumped 400% from last year_ &ndash; to gloss over the less impressive underlying numbers &ndash; _We sold $40 worth of books this year compared to $10 last year_.

\5. In the year 2000, the suburb Deerfield had a deer population that averaged 2.4 per acre. In that year, there were only 3,800 concealed-carry firearm permits on file for Deerfield residents. In 2010, however, the deer population fell to an average of 0.6 an acre, whereas concealed-carry firearm permits increased to more than 40,000. **From this, we can conclude that Deerfield gun ownership is to blame for the decrease in deer population.**

<span class="my-notes">
Guns kill deer. If there were less deer and more guns than before, then it stands to reason that the guns are the cause of the drop in deer population.

I deliberately chose the metric of concealed-carry (CCW) permits over something more obvious, such as hunting licenses or deer tags sold. Generally, deer hunting is not done with the kind of handguns associated with CCW permits. So one objection to this claim is that even if guns are to blame, this is the wrong metric to look at.

However, that's not the _main_ problem, as I see it. I think CCW permits is an OK proxy for hunting licenses. People who

## Data Mashing

Below are the table structures (and some example data) from two sources of information: the city restaurant inspections department and 311 reports. Pretend that the tables all include thousands of rows instead of just the few example rows I've listed.


#### Restaurant inspections



**Restaurant listings**

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Address</th><th>Zip</th><th>Category</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bob's Burgers</td><td>98 Broadway</td><td>10004</td><td>Burgers</td></tr><tr><td>Big Kahuna Pizza</td><td>1200 6th Ave</td><td>11412</td><td>Pizza</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Inspection reports**

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Inspection date</th><th>Restaurant name</th><th>Health grade</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10/14/10</td><td>Bob's Burgers</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>8/3/10</td><td>Baconland</td><td>C</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Violations noted**

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Violation type</th><th>Inspection date</th><th>Restaurant name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unwashed utensils</td><td>8/3/10</td><td>Baconland</td></tr><tr><td>Rodent droppings</td><td>8/3/10</td><td>Baconland</td></tr><tr><td>Refrigerator not cold enough</td><td>10/14/10</td><td>Bob's Burgers</td></tr></tbody></table>


#### 311 Calls that involved rodent sightings

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Intersection</th><th>Call Date</th><th>Rats sighted</th><th>Lat</th><th>Long</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd Ave and 14th Street</td><td>5/2/12</td><td>5</td><td>-37.28237</td><td>83.1234</td></tr><tr><td>Broadway and Jane St.</td><td>3/3/12</td><td>2</td><td>-37.10293</td><td>85.12392139</td></tr></tbody></table>



**Explain the steps you would take to merge the four tables to see if there's a correlation between rat sightings and rodent-related violations noted by restaurant inspectors.**

In other words, I want to know: "Is the number of 311 rat sightings a good indicator of whether nearby restaurants will have a high number of rodent-related health violations?"

How do I get a dataset that would help answer that question?

**Hint:** In the case where you don't have an exact foreign key to use between tables, assume that you're able to also derive geographical coordinates through some third-party program and that you can link datasets by how close they are to a given set of coordinates.

Here's one of the steps:

> In both the violations and inspections tables, create a new field that consists of the **inspection date** and **restaurant name** concatenated together. Then **merge** the inspections and violations table on that new field.


**Now describe the rest of the steps.**


## Visualization

I want to create a visualization so that New York educators can more easily determine which schools need the most help in SAT Math prep.

So I've created two maps. The first shows absolute SAT Math scores for each school in 2010:

![image](/images/class/2013-10-28/SAT-2010.jpg)


The second map shows Math SAT scores in 2012:

![image](/images/class/2013-10-28/SAT-2012.jpg)





You can see the interactive versions of the maps in these links: [2010](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=104fGFiIH8MgjgQ41FhfYiuBOSv3c2uGtSM_eZZ4#map:id=5) and [2012](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=104fGFiIH8MgjgQ41FhfYiuBOSv3c2uGtSM_eZZ4#map:id=6)



1. Describe how these maps might make the data *harder* to comprehend.
2. Propose a different visualization that would more effectively make my point.
3. If this data *must* be shown as a map, how can its visualization styles be changed to at least make it less confusing?
