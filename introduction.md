## The stack

As a pursuit, data journalism has existed for decades, centuries if you include the early works of John Snow and Florence Nightengale. With the rise of personal and cloud computing, and the Web, data journalism has become both more accessible. And yet it's also become more intimidating to newcomers, because the stack of skills no longer involves "only" statistical analysis and design skills, but seemingly, programming, web design and development, database administration, application design, data warehousing. And each of these fields have their own subset of skills, and each of these could (and have) required a lifetime of study. And this is before you even apply the journalism part.

So it's true that data journalism, like the questions it seeks to answer, is complicated. But if it could be done before computers, then the fact we might do it now with PCs, Macs, EC2 instances, smartphones, Arduinos, shouldn't be a barrier.

The goal of *small data Journalism* is not to *uncomplicate* data journalism, but to show it as a series of smaller, manegable pieces &ndash; some more technical than others &ndash; guided by rationality, cleverness, and journalistic pursuit.


## The smaller the data, the bigger the story

Good data journalism involves more than just *big* data, it also looks for the *smallest* data, that is, the most discrete and granular bits of information. 

If you wanted to know how much more in debt you were becoming, you would start out looking at your annual credit card balance. Knowing that, despite your best budgetary planning, you were $1,000 more in debt this year than last is certainly relevant, but doesn't give you much insight on *why*.

By tracking your balance by *month*, you now are looking at smaller, less significant data points. But seen together, they answer more questions than the yearly data points: did your balance drop in the summer, when you took your first overseas vacation in five years? Or during the holidays? If you track your balance *daily*, the questions you can answer become more pointed: has your average spending on the *weekends* jumped because you moved into the city?

Going to the smallest, the most granular data that your credit card company collects &ndash; each transaction &ndash; then you can find the answers you need (though you may not like them). Are you paying more for gas or doctor visits? Or can the $1,000 in additional debt be explained by a recently-developed $5-latt√©-a-morning habit?
