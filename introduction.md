## The stack

As a pursuit, data journalism has existed for decades, centuries if you include the early works of John Snow and Florence Nightengale. With the rise of personal and cloud computing, and the Web, data journalism has become both more accessible. And yet it's also become more intimidating to newcomers, because the stack of skills no longer involves "only" statistical analysis and design skills, but seemingly, programming, web design and development, database administration, application design, data warehousing. And each of these fields have their own subset of skills, and each of these could (and have) required a lifetime of study. And this is before you even apply the journalism part.

So it's true that data journalism, like the questions it seeks to answer, is complicated. But if it could be done before computers, then the fact we might do it now with PCs, Macs, EC2 instances, smartphones, Arduinos, shouldn't be a barrier.

The goal of *small data Journalism* is not to *uncomplicate* data journalism, but to show it as a series of smaller, manegable pieces &ndash; some more technical than others &ndash; guided by rationality, cleverness, and journalistic pursuit.


## The smaller the data, the bigger the story

Good data journalism involves more than just *big* data, it also looks for the *smallest* data, that is, the most discrete and granular bits of information. 

If you wanted to know how much more in debt you were becoming, you would start out looking at your annual credit card balance. Knowing that, despite your best budgetary planning, you were $1,000 more in debt this year than last is certainly relevant, but doesn't give you much insight on *why*.

By tracking your balance by *month*, you now are looking at smaller, less significant data points. But seen together, they answer more questions than the yearly data points: did your balance drop in the summer, when you took your first overseas vacation in five years? Or during the holidays? If you track your balance *daily*, the questions you can answer become more pointed: has your average spending on the *weekends* jumped because you moved into the city?

Going to the smallest, the most granular data that your credit card company collects &ndash; each transaction &ndash; now you can find the answers you need (though you may not like them). Are you paying more for gas or doctor visits? Or can the $1,000 in additional debt be explained by a recently-developed $5-latt√©-a-morning habit?

### Journalism that counts

One of my favorite stories:

TK Atul Gawande

If you strip away journalism to its core: you have the act of questions. Then data journalism is counting.

And if data journalism is just counting, then anyone, hopefully everyone, can be seen as asking questions -- and counting. My purpose for putting together *small data Journalism* is to help return it to its TK. With technology, the counting becomes



## About sdJ

Information about small data Journalism, how it was built, about me, the editor, and the data journalism class I'm teaching.

### Current status of sdJ

You can see updates to sDJ on the blog. Or follow me on Twitter &ndash; @dancow &ndash; or the Github repo for updates.

**As of September 2013:** My original goal was to collect my favorite articles and books about data journalism to provide, and then to write a few essays

I've put together a list of readings and will just add more as I remember them. For my class, I want to put together some thorough guides to some all-purpose tools, including spreadsheets and the web inspector.
